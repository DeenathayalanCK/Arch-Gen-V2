# Classify each sentence into zero or more of these categories:

# - business: user actions, goals, workflows, or domain behavior
# - service: named software systems, APIs, or backend components
# - data: databases, storage, or persistence
# - infra: cloud, servers, scaling, networking

# Return JSON exactly like this:

# {
#   "business": [],
#   "service": [],
#   "data": [],
#   "infra": []
# }

# Rules:
# - User actions ALWAYS belong to business
# - Do NOT infer services from verbs
# - Use original sentences only
# - JSON only
