Classify each sentence into zero or more of these categories:

- business: user actions, goals, workflows, or domain behavior
- service: named software systems, APIs, or backend components
- data: databases, storage, or persistence
- infra: cloud, servers, scaling, networking

Return JSON exactly like this:

{
  "business": [],
  "service": [],
  "data": [],
  "infra": []
}

Rules:
- User actions ALWAYS belong to business
- Do NOT infer services from verbs
- Use original sentences only
- JSON only
