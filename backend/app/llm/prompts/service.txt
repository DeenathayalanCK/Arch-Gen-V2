Extract application services.

You MAY infer a service from a business action.

Return JSON exactly like this:

{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": ""
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Infer at most ONE service per sentence
- Services must be application-level (not data or infra)
- Do NOT invent databases, queues, or cloud resources
- Names should end with "Service"
- JSON only
